Example entries for traditional sysvinit style inittab:
e1:2345:respawn:/sbin/egetty 0 wlan0
e2:2345:respawn:/sbin/egetty 0 eth0 console

egetty [0-9] <dev> [console|waitif|debug]

'waitif' means egetty will wait for the device to come up.
If 'waitif' is not given egetty will try to bring up the given interface.

Use: "$ econsole eth0"

Scanning for egettys:
$ econsole eth0 scan

Then you can connect to a specific egetty with:
$ econsole eth0 00:0c:6b:24:d2:c8 0

You may have to modify /etc/securetty
Look at what 'login' logs.
Add for example 'pts/1'.
